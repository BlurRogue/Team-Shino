						<p>Hey, I'm Bryce. I'm currently studying Game Development and Design at Purdue University. Working on video games has been a passion of mine ever since I was 11 years old. After I graduate I hope to work for possibily a small studio aiming to really make something more than just a AAA game; something with meaning and love behind. My favorite games are usually RPGs and FPS games.</p>

				<div class="info-about">
						<p>As an undergraduate student at Purdue University’s Polytechnic Insitute college, I aspire for a role within the tech world and industry after I graduate. My interest in gaming stems from when I got my first desktop computer at age 5, playing Plants vs. Zombies. The unique and cartoony style of the graphics drew me into the game and the gameplay simplicity and ease allowed for mass enjoyment. Eventually, I would convince my parents to buy me a Xbox 360 and this would introduce me to a brand new genre and type of gaming that would influence me to pursue a tech based career in the future. I enjoy a wide variety of games such as FPS multiplayers, single player RPGs and turn based strategy games.

						<p>Hello! My name is Brian Kim, currently pursuing a major in Game Development and Design at Purdue University. Originally from California, my aspiration is to contribute to one of the big gaming industries, leveraging the skills I've acquired during my time at Purdue. My passion for gaming traces back to my early exposure with my first DSI XL, where I delved into titles like Pokémon Diamond and Kirby. These experiences have fueled my commitment to the dynamic and creative realm of game development. As of right now, my favorite games to play are Valorant, Siege, TFT, and RoR2.
