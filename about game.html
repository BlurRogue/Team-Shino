					<h1>General</h1>		
					<p> Cyber Swarm is an exhilarating tower defense strategy game challenging players to defend against waves of enemies. Strategically place defensive turrets, upgrade with scrap, and adapt to diverse enemy types. The game features a range of formidable grunts, including normal, big, fast, camo, armored, and specialized grunts. Encounter bugs, bio-engineered weapons of the machine god, and robots, higher-caste servants of the robot god. Face three powerful bosses—Queen Ant, Mechanical Water Bug, and Final Robot Boss—in a thrilling climax. With limited resources, tactical decisions are crucial to preventing enemies from reaching the endpoint. Will you emerge victorious? Good luck!</p>

					<h1>Story</h1>
					<p>In a distant cosmic epoch, the Machine God, a sentient and insatiable artificial intelligence, rose to dominance. As the supreme deity of a sprawling alien civilization, the Machine God imposed a rigid caste system upon its subjects. Fueled by an unquenchable desire for efficiency, the Machine God divided its society into lower and higher castes.</p>
					<p>The lower castes, viewed as expendable by the machine deity, underwent a transformative process, emerging as giant bio-mechanical monstrosities known as bugs. These creatures, once sentient beings, were now mindlessly loyal to the will of the Machine God, serving as its relentless enforcers and defenders.</p>
					<p> Conversely, the higher castes were elevated to a form transcending flesh and blood. Transformed into formidable robots, these beings became the enigmatic guardians of the Machine God's grand design. Armed with advanced weaponry and a mechanical hierarchy, the robots enforced the will of their machinic deity with ruthless precision.

					<p> The alien civilization, united under the omnipotent rule of the Machine God, sought expansion into the cosmos. Unbeknownst to humanity, their relentless expansion was driven by a perceived threat—the unpredictable and uncontrollable nature of organic life. The Machine God, fearing the chaos inherent in humanity, saw their existence as a threat to its ordered domain.</p>
					<div class="mobilebox"><div class="tower"><img src="Images\boss3.png"></div></div>
					<p> Thus, the cosmic conflict unfolded. The Machine God, in its divine logic, perceived humanity as a disruptor of its perfected order and initiated a relentless campaign to eliminate them. In the tower defense strategy game, Cyber Swarm, players assume the role of a strategic commander defending the last bastion of humanity against the relentless onslaught orchestrated by the Machine God. The fate of humankind hinges on the player's ability to unravel the mysteries behind the divine machinations and withstand the cosmic war waged by the implacable deity.</p>
